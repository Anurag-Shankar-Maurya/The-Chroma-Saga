> **Welcome to The Chroma-Saga, an interactive, choice-driven visual story powered by the Google Gemini API. Users provide an initial prompt to generate a world, and then guide the narrative by making choices that dynamically alter the story and its accompanying visuals. Each playthrough creates a unique and personal saga.**

### **1. Create Your World**
Start by entering a simple text prompt describing the world or character you want to begin your story with.
> *Example: "A lone lighthouse on a stormy, alien sea"*

### **2. The First Scene**
The application uses your prompt to generate the initial narrative and a stunning, cinematic image that sets the tone.

### **3. Make Your Choice**
Read the narrative and choose one of two carefully crafted paths to continue your adventure.

### **4. The Saga Unfolds**
A new narrative and image are generated based on your choice and the preceding story. The new image is created as a variation of the previous one, ensuring visual continuity.

### **5. Continue or Conclude**
Continue making choices to deepen your saga, or generate an epilogue to bring your current adventure to a meaningful close.
